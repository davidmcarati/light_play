# Light Play

A lightweight, browser-based 2D game engine and creative suite. Build, edit, and play 2D games entirely in your browser — no installs, no accounts, no cloud required.

## What is Light Play?

Light Play is an all-in-one tool for creating 2D games. It includes built-in editors for sprites, tilemaps, animations, and scenes, plus a game runtime that lets you test and export your creations as standalone HTML5 packages.

Everything runs locally. Your projects, assets, and settings stay on your machine.
